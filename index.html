            My name is David Kwesi Afriyie, a 23-year-old Ghanaian currently pursuing my studies at 
            Brigham Young University (BYU) . I have a strong interest in Tech and enjoy exploring different cultures 
            through food. While I have a deep appreciation for music, I tend to enjoy it more as a listener than a performer. I am passionate about personal growth and value opportunities that allow me to engage with diverse perspectives 
            in both academic and social settings.
